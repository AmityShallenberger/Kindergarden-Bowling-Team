# Kindergarden-Bowling-Team

TO-DO:

 - Finish Kindergarden Bowling.
	
 - Add File Persistence to Kindergarden Bowling.
	(Load/save menu item).
	Save: object -> JSON -> save file in text format.
	Load: Read file -> JSON -> object.
	 > 1 game = 1 object. Many games = many objects. Array of scores.

	PAIN POINTS: 
	 - Can't get library installed.
	 - Need to understand package management.

	Package manager
	 - Handles installing third-party / first-party libraries.
	 - Ex. C# has Nuget, Objective-C has Cocopods, Python has Pip, Java has a lot (Maven, Ant, Gradle), JavaScript has NPM.

	When you compile, you create a .class file.
	 => We do not want to put these .class files into the repo.
	 => .gitignore file can be used to permanently prevent these from being added.

 - Add .gitignore file.
